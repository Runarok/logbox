# 🎮 Games

Gaming has been one of those constant hobbies for me — part relaxation, part curiosity, and sometimes just short bursts of obsession.
I don’t stick to one genre or platform, but I do have my patterns and preferences when it comes to what I enjoy playing.

## 📱 Mobile Gaming

Most of my gaming happens on mobile.
My main Google Play profile:
**Username:** `RunarokHrafn`
**Level:** 84 *(as of 5th Sept 2025)*
**Games Synced:** 746
**Achievements Unlocked:** 2,108

I usually prefer games that **track progress** — either through achievements or cloud saves.
After spending hours on games only to lose everything once, I started leaning towards titles where progress sticks.

### 🐉 Pokémon-Style Games

I’ve always liked games with **team-building and progression mechanics**:

* **Coromon** — [Play Store Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tragsoft.coromon)
  → Built a **max-level team** of six, each at level **99**.
* **Dynamons World** — [Play Store Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.funtomic.dynamons3)

There used to be a **Hexamon bot** on Telegram that I played intensely — grinded for nearly **22 hours straight** in one day.
Ironically, I accidentally deleted my Telegram account right after, losing all that progress. I stopped using Telegram entirely after that.

### ⏳ Playing Style & Achievements

I play **in bursts** — sometimes grinding a single game for hours, sometimes switching across multiple short ones.
I aim for **achievements**, **high scores**, and **max levels** — short-term grinds but with a **long-term goal**:

> *Reaching level 99 on Google Play* — more of a quiet, ongoing challenge than an urgent target.

I’ve used XP booster apps a couple of times to jump 10–15 levels quickly, but I haven’t done that in a long while.
Now it’s just about playing steadily.

### 🛡️ Clash of Clans Phase

I once played **Clash of Clans** pretty heavily, managing **four accounts** at levels roughly around **13, 14, 12, and 11**.
Eventually, I left the game when it started feeling more overwhelming than fun.

## 🕹️ Online Browser Gaming

Aside from mobile and PC, I’ve spent time on **online browser-based games** too — especially on **[CrazyGames](https://www.crazygames.com/)**.
I’ve tried several small titles there over the years, just exploring and testing out quick casual games.
Some screenshots and snippets from these are also saved in my [PlayGrounds Repo](https://github.com/TempestAethel/PlayGrounds/).

### 🎯 Deadshot.io

One online game I played a lot was **[Deadshot.io](https://deadshot.io/)** — a browser-based FPS.
I grinded it until I unlocked **4 legendary skins**.
The funny-unlucky part? My **first three legendary skins** were the exact same one: **Royal Sniper** —
just three different variants: *clean*, *worn*, and *rugged*.
The fourth skin finally broke the cycle.

## 🖥️ PC Gaming

I don’t play as much on PC compared to mobile, but a few games really stuck with me:

* **Uncharted: The Lost Legacy** *(memorable story and pacing)*
* **Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End** *(one of my favorites)*
* **Prototype 1 & Prototype 2** *(easily some of the most fun I’ve had on PC)*

These aren’t games I grind repeatedly — they’re more about immersion and enjoying the experience fully.

## 🗂️ My Gaming Repos & Extras

I keep parts of my gaming history documented here and there:

* **PlayGrounds Repo** — [View on GitHub](https://github.com/TempestAethel/PlayGrounds/)
  *(Screenshots and small snippets from games I’ve played.)*

* **Crown Game Walkthrough** — [View Walkthrough](https://runarok.github.io/GenAI-plus/Experiments/Extras/Crown/index.html?path=crown-basic)
  *(Documented the starting 60 levels of my puzzle game “Crowns.”)*

## 🎯 Gaming Approach

For me, gaming isn’t about competitive rankings or online trends.
I’m **not into battle royale games** like PUBG or Fortnite, though I’ve played a few light FPS games like **FRAG** just for variety.

I prefer:

* Short bursts of focused grinding
* Games with **clear progress paths**
* Collecting achievements and maxing levels
* Puzzle-solving and creative mechanics
* Revisiting games that are relaxing to replay

At the same time, I rarely stay locked into one game for long — I enjoy exploring, finishing, and moving on.

## 🧩 Final Thoughts

Gaming has always been **a mix of exploration and small personal goals** for me.
Sometimes I dive deep into one title for days; sometimes I drift between ten different games in a week.
It’s less about competition and more about **enjoyment, progression, and discovery**.

From grinding **1000+ games** on mobile to revisiting PC favorites, to random browser experiments,
it’s become an ongoing part of how I relax and reset.
