# GitHub & My Journey with It

I knew about GitHub long before I actually started using it, but for a long time, it stayed in the *“I’ll get into it someday”* category.  
I understood its importance for coding, projects, and collaboration — but I couldn’t find the right reason to begin.  
That reason finally came through an internship.

## 🌱 Where It Started — Skolar

I joined **Skolar**, an internship program, where part of the requirement was to **upload assignments to GitHub**.  
That was the push I needed to finally start.

- My very first repository was called **`Skolar`**.  
- It wasn’t fancy, but it taught me the basics — committing changes, pushing updates, organizing files.  
- It became my entry point into understanding **how GitHub works** rather than just knowing about it.

Over time, I realized I needed a better structure, so I created a new repo called **Guides**.  
That’s where all my Skolar assignments live now, neatly organized:

## 📌 Evolving Beyond Skolar

After Skolar, GitHub stopped being “just a requirement” and became **a workspace I rely on**.  
I started creating new repositories, experimenting with different structures, and learning how to manage projects better.

- **Understanding branching & version control** → figuring out how to keep work clean and trackable.  
- **Making things public vs. private** → deciding what’s worth sharing openly.  
- **Organizing personal projects** → using GitHub as a storage hub for code, notes, and experiments.

The **Guides** repo naturally became my main place to **collect, organize, and update** a lot of my work.

## 📚 Guides — More Than Assignments

Over time, the **Guides** repo evolved beyond Skolar.  
It became a place where I keep **personal data, references, and curated interests**.  
From coding notes to personal archives — it started reflecting more of **how I learn and build**.

One of my favorite additions there is my **book-making work**.  
I enjoy creating structured, aesthetic documents, and GitHub turned into the place where I can **store, update, and refine** them without clutter.

## 🔄 How I Use GitHub Now

GitHub isn’t just a platform for me anymore — it’s part of my workflow.

- **Learning** → I track experiments, code snippets, and problem-solving approaches.  
- **Organizing** → Personal data, guides, curated lists, and archives all stay structured here.  
- **Building** → Repositories for projects, automation ideas, and exploration.  
- **Documenting** → Books, notes, and resources I want to keep accessible.

I’ve slowly shifted from seeing GitHub as a “submission tool” to seeing it as **an evolving library** of what I’m working on and learning.

## 🧩 Where It’s Going

Right now, **Guides** is the central repo where most of my organized data lives — assignments, books, curated interests, and references.  
But GitHub itself has become more than just storage: it’s a **timeline** of how I’ve grown, learned, and built over time.

What started with a single **Skolar** assignment repo turned into something much bigger — a workspace, a library, and a personal archive I keep improving as I go.
