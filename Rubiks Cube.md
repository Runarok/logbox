# Rubik’s Cube Journey 🧩

I got into solving Rubik’s Cubes somewhere around my **8th or 9th standard**, and it started in a pretty casual way — during a **PE class**. The 3×3 cube was introduced, and while most people didn’t take much interest, I got curious and decided to learn it properly.

The **first tutorial** I used back then is still online:

I’d still recommend this newer, simpler one as well:

## 3×3 Cube 🟩

* The first cube I ever solved.
* Built up **muscle memory** for the moves over time, so I don’t really “think” while solving it anymore — my hands handle most of it.
* My **fastest solve**: \~**45 seconds**, though I’ll admit I got lucky with the last layer on that one.
* These days, I can still pick up a 3×3 and solve it without much thought, but I don’t time myself anymore.

## 4×4 Cube 🟦

* Got this during my **5th semester of BE** because I wanted to push myself beyond the basics.
* Spent about a **week grinding algorithms**, getting comfortable with parity cases and learning to handle the extra complexity.
* My **fastest solve**: around **8 minutes**.
* Unlike the 3×3, my **muscle memory isn’t as strong** here — I usually have to recall steps consciously if I pick it up after a gap.

## 5×5 Cube 🟨

* Picked it up around the same time as the 4×4, also during **5th semester**.
* Learned it gradually over **2–3 weeks** — mostly during a **trip** where I had enough downtime to practice.
* My **fastest solve**: about **17 minutes**.
* Similar to the 4×4, I can solve it if I refresh my memory a bit, but I haven’t kept up consistent practice.

## Notes & Thoughts

* I don’t have much “proof” of my solves since I wasn’t documenting things back then — I just learned and moved on.
* These days, I don’t actively practice speed-solving, but I still enjoy picking up the cubes occasionally, especially the 3×3.
* For me, it’s more about the **challenge and flow** rather than chasing records.
