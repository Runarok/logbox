# Manga • Manhwa • Manhua • Comics

Reading has been a constant — sometimes for the story, sometimes just for the vibe.  
I started with manga and slowly explored manhwa, manhua, and even a few western comics along the way.  
Different formats, different moods — each carries its own space for me.

## 📖 Manga

I’ve probably read **more manga than I’ve watched anime**, even if I don’t track them anywhere.  
Manga has a slower, more grounded rhythm — uncolored panels, quieter pacing — and that makes it hit differently.  
I tend to gravitate towards **rom-coms**, **existential stories**, and **Junji Ito’s unsettling works**.

**Physical copies I own** *(gifted by my brother)*:
- *Dragon Ball* & *Dragon Ball Z* complete volume packs  
- *Bleach* volume pack  
- *Junji Ito’s Uzumaki* and *Tomie*  
- *Your Name* novel

I read most manga digitally, but these hardcopies feel special — they’re less about convenience and more about the experience itself.

> *“Manga’s uncolored worlds make you notice details you’d otherwise overlook — slower, but more immersive.”*

## 🌿 Manhwa

Manhwa became my go-to for **fun, faster-paced storytelling**.  
Colored panels, cleaner pacing, and protagonists who actually **grow** over time — that’s what keeps me hooked.  
I’ve read a lot here, but some stand out as the ones I keep returning to:

**Most reread / memorable manhwa:**
- **Solo Leveling**  
- **The Beginning After the End (TBATE)**  
- **The Heavenly Demon Can’t Live a Normal Life**  
- **The Damned Reincarnation**  
- **Return of the Mad Demon**  
- **Return of the Mount Hua Sect**

Some aren’t necessarily “favorites,” but they were the most fun to revisit.  
One exception though — **The Lazy Lord Masters the Sword** — this one hits differently.  
It’s slower, more introspective, and focuses on **self-improvement** rather than constant action.

> *“Manhwa, for me, is comfort — fun worlds, growth arcs, and just enough unpredictability.”*

## 🐉 Manhua

Manhua is trickier for me. I read them, but they rarely leave a lasting mark.  
Most of the ones I’ve tried lack that **unique identity** manga or manhwa tend to have, so I usually leave them around the **100-chapter mark**.  
Still, there are a couple of exceptions:

**Most reread manhua:**
- **The Immortal Emperor Luo Wuji Has Returned** — I keep coming back to this one for some reason and end up rereading it fully each time.  
- **100,000 Levels of Body Refining: All the Dogs I Raise Are the Emperor** — chaotic, but oddly entertaining.

Most others I’ve picked up follow similar power-fantasy patterns, but these two stand out enough to revisit.

## 📚 Comics & Other Reads

These are separate from my usual reading flow but shaped how I got into stories early on:

- **Archie 1000 Page Mega Digest** — playful, timeless, pure nostalgia.  
- **The Adventures of Tintin** — my early introduction to mystery and adventure.

They don’t overlap much with my manga/manhwa habits but carry a different kind of comfort.

## 📝 Tracking vs. Reading

I used to track **anime** in detail once — went through hundreds of titles on Anime-Planet and logged everything I could remember back then.  
That snapshot is still my most complete update:  
[**Anime-Planet Profile**](https://www.anime-planet.com/users/TempestAethel)

But I **don’t track manga, manhwa, or manhua** anywhere.  
I read a lot more than my profile would ever suggest — these formats move faster, and updating every single one started feeling like work.  
These days, I focus more on actually reading than maintaining lists.

## 🧩 Final Thoughts

If I had to summarize:  
- **Manga** → quieter, slower, existential, and deeply immersive.  
- **Manhwa** → fun, colorful, growth-driven, and easy to dive into.  
- **Manhua** → occasional reads; only a few are memorable enough to revisit.  
- **Comics** → nostalgic, light, and part of early storytelling memories.

For me, it’s less about counting completions and more about finding something that fits my mood at the time.
