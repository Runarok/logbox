# *"Nuvve Kalavaina"*

## Telugu Lyrics

Nuvve kalavaina…  
Kalalona veenaina…  
Kanulanni pilichelaa  
Naa paata neeveyna…

Ee oopiri nuvve,  
Ee velugu nuvve,  
Nee oopiri toone prathi  
Chinuku paadutundhe…  

Nee choopule cheppani prema,  
Naa manasutho kalisina maata,  
Oka sogasaina nimishamlo  
Nee lokamlo maripoya…

Nee peru palukaka mundhe  
Manasu paata paadutundhe,  
Nee oopiri vinaka mundhe  
Kalalu cherukuntundhe…

Gatham marachina velalalo  
Nee dhyaaname undi,  
Prathi oopiri nee thalapatho  
Naa vente nadusthundhi…  

Velugu paadithe gaalilo  
Nee paata vinipisthundhi,  
Kalalanni cherukuntunnaa  
Nuvve naalo unnavu…

Nuvve kalavaina…  
Kalalona veenaina…  
Kanulanni pilichelaa  
Naa paata neeveyna…

## English meaning

You’re the dream I found,  
The song inside my dreams,  
As if my eyes call for you,  
You’ve become my melody  

You are this breath,  
You are this light,  
Every little drop sings  
Along with your breath…  

In your eyes lives an unspoken love,   
My heart speaks the same language,  
In a single beautiful moment,  
I got lost in your world…  
 
Before I even call your name,  
My heart starts to sing,  
Before I even hear your breath,  
My dreams reach for you…  

In the moments that forgot the past,  
Only thoughts of you remain,  
Every breath carries you  
And walks beside me…  

When the light sings in the wind,  
I hear your song within it,  
As my dreams keep unfolding,  
I find you inside me…
