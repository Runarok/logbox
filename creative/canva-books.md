# Canva & Books 📚🎨

This started in a pretty unplanned way — Canva wasn’t something I actively decided to learn or spend time on at first.
It began when I was **helping teachers design internship posters or event invites**. Over time, though, I realized Canva could be **more than just quick edits** — and it naturally became part of my process for creating books.

## How Books Came Into the Picture 📖

I’ve always been curious about books but pretty selective with what I read. I like my reading to feel **worth the time** — something that either gives me perspective, teaches me something, or just makes me think differently.

Some of the first books I picked up were:

* *The 48 Laws of Power* — a friend recommended it and lent me their copy.
* *Ikigai* — exploring meaning and purpose.
* *No Longer Human* by Osamu Dazai — darker, more existential.
* *The Myth of Sisyphus* by Albert Camus — deep and thought-provoking.

I’ve also always leaned toward **comic-style books** and visual reading — which naturally aligned with using Canva later.

## First Steps in Making Books ✍️

Eventually, I wanted to **create my own books** — not exactly full novels but more like structured ideas, notes, and concepts collected into readable formats.

The first book I made was:
**“17 Ground Rules of Disciplined Life”**

* Inspired partly by *The 48 Laws of Power*, *Atomic Habits*, and my own reflections.
* Focused on discipline, habits, and personal systems I believe in.

After that came:
**“Edges”** — a book about **the traps we, as humans, tend to fall into**.
It’s a mix of observations, patterns, and personal takeaways.

## AI + My Writing Process 🤝

I use **AI as an ally**, not a replacement.
Sometimes, I don’t feel the need to craft **perfect sentences** — I care more about **getting the core ideas out** first. AI helps with structuring, phrasing, and polishing when I want to focus on the content itself.

That said, there’s also this part of me that **wants to write everything on my own** someday — fully, in my own words and style. My interests keep expanding, so focusing deeply on just one book at a time is challenging right now, but I want to **come back and build them gradually**.

## Where I Publish Them 📂

I keep my books here:
🔗 **[Books Repository](https://github.com/Runarok/Books/)**

It’s where I upload finished works, ongoing drafts, and experiments.
Some are more polished, while others are still evolving.

## What’s Next

I don’t have a strict roadmap — I like keeping this space **fluid**.
I plan to:

* Keep creating **small, focused books** around ideas I find interesting.
* Slowly refine my personal writing style alongside AI-assisted drafts.
* Explore more **visual storytelling** using Canva — mixing structured text with comics, infographics, and aesthetics.

This isn’t a rushed process — it’s something I want to **grow alongside me**, book by book.
