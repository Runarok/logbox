# 🧠 Thought Box

A casual, catch-all space for storing thoughts, logic puzzles, short coding challenges, or curiosities triggered by content like YouTube Shorts, Reels, Tweets, or blog snippets.  
If it sparks a "Wait, how would I solve that?" or "Can this be built?", it belongs here.

This isn't about polish — it's about momentum. Raw ideas, quick solutions, or deep mental puzzles — all tracked and categorized.

## 📂 Subfolders

* **[`Programmatic/`](./Programmatic)**  
  Hands-on coding thoughts or challenges. These often begin as a snippet from a short video or tweet, and evolve into actual code.  
  _Example_: 1-line array operations, micro-algorithms, TikTok code prompts.

* **[`Conceptual/`](./Conceptual)**  
  Logic-based or reasoning-heavy problems that don't necessarily need code.  
  _Example_: Cheryl’s Birthday, prisoner hat problems, paradoxes.

* **[`Annotations/`](./Annotations)**  
  Notes and reflections on concepts from books, articles, or philosophical thought.  
  _Example_: Key takeaways from *The 48 Laws of Power* or reinterpretations of mental models.

* **[`Flash Logs/`](./Flash%20Logs)**  
  Sudden insights, emotionally-driven observations, or internal logic flashes that don’t neatly fit elsewhere. Think of this as your scratchpad for clarity during cognitive storms.  
  _Example_: Realizations on how people misuse logic, moments of raw strategic thought, or emotional-cleanup reframed through precision.

* **[`Media Summaries/`](./Media%20Summaries)**  
  Summaries or detailed notes on movies, TV shows, documentaries, or other media content.  
  _Example_: Episode breakdowns, story arcs, character analyses from *Stranger Things* or other shows.

## 💡 Purpose

> “Some ideas don’t arrive with a title. You just catch them mid-thought.”

This folder exists to make sure those don’t get lost. Whether the spark is technical, emotional, or philosophical — if it sharpens your inner lens or nudges your logic, store it here.
