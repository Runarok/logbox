### **The 10 possible dates Cheryl gives:**

* May 15, May 16, May 19
* June 17, June 18
* July 14, July 16
* August 14, August 15, August 17

---

### **Clues:**

1. **Albert is told the month.**
2. **Bernard is told the day.**

---

### **Albert says:**

> *"I don’t know when Cheryl’s birthday is, but I know that Bernard doesn’t know either."*

This means:

* Albert knows the **month**, but **not the day**, so that rules out months with unique days (if any).
* But crucially, he also says **he knows Bernard doesn’t know the birthday** either.
* That implies: **The month Albert sees does not contain any unique day** (i.e., no date in that month has a day that appears only once in the entire list).

Let’s look at the **days and their frequencies**:

* **14** → July 14, August 14 → appears twice
* **15** → May 15, August 15 → appears twice
* **16** → May 16, July 16 → appears twice
* **17** → June 17, August 17 → appears twice
* **18** → June 18 → appears **once**
* **19** → May 19 → appears **once**

So if the month were **May** or **June**, it could have been **May 19** or **June 18**, which are unique days.

If Albert had **May** or **June**, he **couldn't be sure** Bernard doesn't know the birthday (since Bernard might have been told a unique day). But Albert **is sure**, so the month **can't be May or June**.

✅ **That eliminates: May and June**.
**Remaining dates:**

* July 14, July 16
* August 14, August 15, August 17

---

### **Bernard says:**

> *"At first I didn’t know when Cheryl’s birthday was, but now I know."*

* Bernard knows the **day**, and now, after Albert’s statement, he is **sure** of the birthday.

From the remaining days:

* **14** → July 14, August 14
* **15** → August 15
* **16** → July 16
* **17** → August 17

Bernard must have been told a day that appears **only once** in the remaining list.

That eliminates **14**, because it appears twice (July 14 & August 14).

✅ Remaining valid dates for Bernard:

* July 16
* August 15
* August 17

---

### **Albert says:**

> *"Then I also know when Cheryl’s birthday is."*

Albert only knows the **month**. From Bernard’s clue, Albert is now certain of the full date.
That means **only one of the remaining valid dates is in the month Albert was told**.

Let’s check:

* **July** has: July 16
* **August** has: August 15, August 17

So if Albert had **August**, he wouldn’t know which one.
If Albert had **July**, he would know it’s **July 16**.

✅ Therefore, the birthday must be: **July 16**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **July 16**
