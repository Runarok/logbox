### **1. Never Outshine the Master**

* **Original**: Always make superiors feel superior.
* **Takeaway**: Move in silence. Let others feel celebrated while you secure the real gains. Adapt how you do it so they never see the play — only the praise.

---

### **2. Never Put Too Much Trust in Friends, Learn How to Use Enemies**

* **Original**: Friends are emotional; enemies are strategic.
* **Takeaway**: Give value, but never grip too tight. Keep friends close, enemies closer — but sweeten your presence just enough that even your rivals hesitate to team up against you. Let everyone think they’re winning while you’re positioning.

---

### **3. Conceal Your Intentions**

* **Original**: Clarity invites sabotage.
* **Takeaway**: Give just enough to distract, never enough to decode. Let silence be the smoke — real moves stay buried deeper.
  
---

### **4. Always Say Less Than Necessary**

* **Original**: Power thrives in silence and mystery.
* **Takeaway**: Say what you want — but only to those who won’t weaponize it. If someone finds harm in everything, leave them behind. Play it safe, not small. Silence isn’t fear — it’s control.

---

### **5. So Much Depends on Reputation — Guard It With Your Life**

* **Original**: Reputation is armor and weapon.
* **Takeaway**: Be so useful, so consistent, that your flaws get ignored. Stay human, but make your value undeniable — no one betrays what they still benefit from.

---

### **6. Court Attention at All Costs**

* **Original**: Obscurity kills influence.
* **Takeaway**: Let them know you help, not how much you hold. Show warmth, not your core. Stay the person they respect even if they don’t fully understand.

---

### **7. Get Others to Do the Work for You, but Always Take the Credit**

* **Original**: Results matter more than effort.
* **Takeaway**: Spot what’s easy for you but hard for them — then fix it without showing how little it cost you. Let them feel rescued, not embarrassed. Power isn’t in showing off; it’s in knowing when not to.

---

### **8. Make People Come to You — Use Bait if Necessary**

* **Original**: Whoever chases, loses power.

---

### **9. Win Through Your Actions, Never Through Argument**

* **Original**: Convincing with words breeds resentment.
* **Takeaway**: Argue only when it’s fast, clear, and worth it. If it drags or dents egos, stop talking. Just act. Such People trust what they see, not what you explain.

---

### **10. Infection: Avoid the Unhappy and Unlucky**

* **Original**: Emotions are contagious.
* **Takeaway**: Be there for the struggling, not the stagnant. If someone’s hurting but trying, they’re worth your time. If they just complain and stay stuck, walk. Their chaos spreads.

---

### **11. Learn to Keep People Dependent on You**

* **Original**: The more they need you, the more power you hold.
* **Takeaway**: Power comes from what you keep quiet — your sources, your skills, your systems. Stay useful to others, but reveal little. The less they understand your leverage, the more they depend on it.

---

### **12. Use Selective Honesty to Disarm**

* **Original**: A single act of honesty can cover decades of deception.

---

### **14. Pose as a Friend, Work as a Spy**

* **Original**: Learn by watching, not announcing.

### **15. Crush Your Enemy Totally**

* **Original**: Half-defeated enemies always return.
* **Takeaway**: Don’t just defeat a threat — erase it in every form: emotionally, structurally, symbolically. No loose ends. No echoes. No path for revenge. End it so completely, their will to return dies with it.

### **16. Use Absence to Increase Respect and Honor**

* **Original**: Presence breeds familiarity; absence creates power.
