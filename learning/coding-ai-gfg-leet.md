# Coding, AI, GFG & LeetCode üß©

Coding has been one of those things I‚Äôve always liked but never fully defined.
I got into it around **8th grade**, when we first had a coding-related subject in school. Something about **automation, logic, and seeing effort come together after running the code** made it click for me.

I wouldn‚Äôt call myself an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù even now ‚Äî it‚Äôs more like I **pick up concepts quickly** but never aimed for a full-time software job, so I didn‚Äôt grind the way some do. Still, coding stayed a constant thread, shaping projects, experiments, and side quests along the way.

## Getting Into Problem-Solving ‚ö°

I started exploring **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)** and **LeetCode** ‚Äî not heavily for competitive coding, but more as **structured practice**. Most of my problem-solving was a mix of **me + AI**, learning as I went instead of brute forcing everything alone.

Repos where I keep my solutions:

* **LeetCode Solutions** ‚Üí [Runarok/LeetSolutions](https://github.com/Runarok/LeetSolutions)
* **GFG Solutions** ‚Üí [Runarok/GeeksForGeeks-solutions](https://github.com/Runarok/GeeksForGeeks-solutions)

## Automating & Linking Guides üîó

At some point, I got into **automating my submissions** and keeping my progress synced. I made a couple of guides for linking GFG and LeetCode to GitHub:
* [Sync GFG to GitHub (PDF)](https://github.com/Runarok/Guides/blob/main/Code%20Manual/Github%20and%20Softwares/Sync%20GeeksforGeeks%20to%20Github.pdf)
* [Sync LeetCode to GitHub (PDF)](https://github.com/Runarok/Guides/blob/main/Code%20Manual/Github%20and%20Softwares/Sync%20Leetcode%20to%20Github.pdf)
This helped me avoid manual uploads and keep my coding journey documented smoothly.

## GFG Python & JS Projects üêç‚ö°

While exploring GFG, I also tried out the **mini-projects** they provide. I separated them by language:
* **Python Projects** ‚Üí [Runarok/gfg-py-projects](https://github.com/Runarok/gfg-py-projects)
* **JavaScript Projects** ‚Üí [Runarok/gfg-js-projects](https://github.com/Runarok/gfg-js-projects)
Nothing too big, but they were useful for practicing fundamentals and understanding how to structure small apps.

## Esoteric Languages üé≤

At one point, I fell into the rabbit hole of **esoteric programming languages** ‚Äî languages built more for creativity or challenge than practicality.
I documented them here:
[Esoteric Languages](https://github.com/Runarok/Guides/tree/main/Code%20Quest/Esoteric%20Languages)
This was more curiosity-driven than anything else, but it added a new layer to how I think about code and syntax design.

## Frontend Experiments üé®

During my **5th and 6th semesters**, I started experimenting with **frontend projects** ‚Äî mostly out of curiosity and wanting to make ideas visual.
I split my work into two main spaces:
* **GenAI (5th sem)** ‚Üí [runarok.github.io/GenAI/](https://runarok.github.io/GenAI/)
* **GenAI-plus (6th sem + later)** ‚Üí [runarok.github.io/GenAI-plus/](https://runarok.github.io/GenAI-plus/)
These are where I tried layouts, interactive pages, and AI-driven tools ‚Äî a mix of testing, learning, and just building things that felt fun.

## Coding + AI ü§ù

AI became a natural part of my workflow, not as a shortcut but as a **partner in learning**.
For DSA problems, I used it to:
* Understand unfamiliar patterns
* Compare approaches
* Automate repetitive setups
* Debug faster
Rather than just giving me answers, AI helped me **connect dots faster** and build context without pausing momentum.

## Where It All Stands Now üìå

* Coding isn‚Äôt something I grind every day, but it‚Äôs still **deeply tied** to how I learn and create.
* I focus less on raw problem counts and more on **learning efficiently** and **building tools**.
* My repos reflect different phases: GFG, LeetCode, guides, esoteric experiments, and frontend projects.
* It‚Äôs not a straight line ‚Äî it‚Äôs more like a **map of interests** growing in parallel.
