MBTI + QoL Insight Framework — Question Generator & Analyzer

A compact, practical README for using two single-paste prompts to generate high-value self-reflection questions and then get a grounded OLQ + MBTI analysis.
Designed to keep input minimal while giving GPT enough data to produce a usable, moral, growth-focused plan.

What this does

Generates 8–12 focused, open questions that cover the 15 SSB OLQs and MBTI signals.

Lets you answer concisely.

Produces a precise, evidence-based analysis and 3 high-impact growth moves — no follow-up questions.



---

Quick start (3 steps)

1. Paste Prompt 1 into your GPT session. Answer the questions it asks (short, honest answers — 1–3 sentences each).


2. After the generator finishes and says “All questions complete…”, paste Prompt 2 and nothing else.


3. Receive a single-session analysis: profile, 15 OLQ scores with evidence, MBTI inference, and 3 growth actions.

Usage notes

Aim for concise answers. You don’t need long stories — clear facts and one-sentence contexts are enough.

This is built for a single-session workflow: generate → answer → analyze. The analyzer is instructed not to ask further questions.

If you want deeper work after the analysis, ask the assistant for a plan (6-week / 4-week, etc.) based on the output.

Prompt 1 — Generate the Questions

```
You know nothing about me beyond what I tell you here.  
Your task: ask me a *balanced set* of thoughtful, open-ended questions — between 8 and 12 in total — that give you enough insight to:

1. Map my strengths and weaknesses against all 15 SSB OLQs.
2. Infer my likely MBTI type and note any possible shadow function distortions.
3. Understand my decision-making style, social behavior, and moral compass well enough to suggest growth actions.

Rules for the questions:
- Each should touch multiple OLQs at once where possible.
- They must be specific enough to give you real data, but broad enough for me to answer without excessive detail.
- They should avoid yes/no format.
- They should explore both my past actions and how I think about challenges.
- Ask them one by one in a natural sequence, but stop after the last question.

When all questions are asked, say: “All questions complete — paste ANALYZE prompt when ready.”
```

Prompt 2 — Analyze Answers

```
Do NOT ask me anything else.  
Use my answers to:

1) Give a 3–5 sentence overall profile describing my strengths, main blindspots, and one moral tension I carry.
2) Score each OLQ (EI, RA, OA, POE, SA, Co, SOR, Inv, SC, SOD, AIG, Liv, Det, Cou, Sta) from 1–5, with one short evidence-based note per score.
3) Suggest my most likely MBTI type and note any signs of shadow distortion, linking this to OLQ patterns.
4) Recommend exactly 3 high-impact growth actions that each target multiple OLQs — one internal mindset shift, one social/behavioral habit, one decision-making discipline.
5) End with a candid 3–4 line reflection on where my actions align or clash with my stated values.

Tone: precise, moral, and grounded. Avoid fluff or vague language.
```

After you get the analysis

If you want that analysis turned into a plan, ask: “Turn this into a 6-week growth plan with weekly focuses and daily 2–5 minute micro-practices.”

If you prefer tactical brevity, ask: “Give me a 4-week sprint with daily practices under 10 minutes.”

Keep a record of the assistant’s OLQ scores — they’re your baseline for follow-up checks.

One final tip Answer briefly, honestly, and with at least one concrete example per question. The analyzer will do the work of stitching your answers into a moral, OLQ-linked roadmap — you only need to give it usable data.
