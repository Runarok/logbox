# Anime

I started watching anime during my 9th or 10th standard summer holidays, and it slowly became a consistent part of my free time. The first few series I watched were **Naruto**, **Fullmetal Alchemist**, **Noragami**, and **Hunter × Hunter** — the ones that pulled me in early on.

At one point, I went through nearly all the anime pages available on Anime-Planet (around 650–700 at the time) over a couple of free days and updated the ones I could remember watching back then. That snapshot is still my most complete update so far, and you can find it here:

I don’t maintain the list as actively anymore. Updating everything I watch started feeling like more work than I wanted, so the profile mostly reflects what I had tracked up until then. These days, I just watch without worrying about logging each title.

Since early 2024, the list hasn’t been fully accurate — not because I stopped watching, but because I rewatch a lot of shows and often have them running in the background while I work. I enjoy that balance of entertainment and familiarity, so my actual count is probably higher than what’s listed.
